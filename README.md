# personal-game-site2
<hr>
maxrivett.com currently has a game, but I would like to include another. That is all. 
<br>
This repo looks barren in terms of commits, and that is due to me pulling it out of the old repo I had it in (`personal-game-site`).
<br>
### You can now find this game at games.maxrivett.com/newgame !

## How to use

- Run `make` in the command line
  - Paste the url it gives (i.e. `http://127.0.0.1:8080`) into the browser and run
